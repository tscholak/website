## Hi

I'm Torsten Scholak. I lead the Foundation Model Lab at [ServiceNow Research](https://www.servicenow.com/research/), where I specialize in turning GPU compute into shipped language models. I co-founded the ServiceNow Language Model (SLAM) initiative and currently focus on the [Apriel model family](https://huggingface.co/collections/ServiceNow-AI/apriel-67f875b85ebbf40d965f00e5), which are open-weight LLMs built for enterprise agentic tasks and efficient inference. Apriel-5B and Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker set state-of-the-art marks on enterprise benchmarks while cutting serving costs and latency. This work was highlighted by Jensen Huang during the ServiceNow Knowledge 2025 keynote.

Previously, I pioneered grammar-constrained decoding with the [PICARD](/publications/picard) text-to-SQL parser (400+ citations, ex-Spider SOTA), co-organized [Deep Learning for Code](https://dl4c.github.io) at ICLR 2022/2023, and helped build [Hasktorch](http://hasktorch.org) to bring GPU-accelerated machine learning to Haskell.

Before all that: I trained as a theoretical physicist in Germany (Bayreuth and Freiburg, Ph.D. 2011), then moved to Canada for a postdoc at the [University of Toronto](https://sites.chem.utoronto.ca/cptg/), before turning to industry at [Unata](https://unata.com) and [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com). Element AI was acquired by ServiceNow in 2021.

That's it. If you actually made it to the end, check the links <a href="#top">up top</a> and maybe say hi: [contact](/contact).
