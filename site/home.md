## Hi!

Welcome to my site. My name is Torsten Scholak. I am employed at ServiceNow Research where I am a senior researcher and project leader in the Human-Machine Interaction Through Language research program.

My current research interests are in the area of deep learning for code, especially with large language models and integrating symbolic reasoning. I am co-organizing the [Deep Learning for Code](https://dl4c.github.io) workshop at ICLR 2022. Before I have been more focused on semantic parsing. I have published several papers on the translation of natural language questions into SQL queries. To date my most sucessful work on this topic is the [PICARD](https://github.com/ElementAI/picard) project, which is a state-of-the-art text-to-SQL parser.

I am a main contributor to [Hasktorch](http://hasktorch.org), a port of PyTorch to the Haskell programming language. I mentored students in Google Summer of Code in 2020 and 2021 that worked on the project. I developed an experimental gradually typed API for Hasktorch that optionally tracks the shapes of tensors and operations in the type system. This is a work in progress. I use Haskell for my research, for development, and for recreation.

My path started in Germany where I grew up and studied theoretical physics at the universities of Bayreuth and Freiburg. This concluded in the summer of 2011 when I earned my PhD. I then moved to Canada to become a researcher at the University of Toronto. I eventually left academia and started working as a software developer and data scientist for a local startup. In 2017, I moved to Montreal and joined [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com), a company that developed machine learning models and solutions for businesses. Element AI was acquired in 2021, and I am now a full-time employee at ServiceNow.
