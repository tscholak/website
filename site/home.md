## Hi!

Welcome, my name is Torsten Scholak. I work at ServiceNow Research, where I am a senior researcher and project leader in the Human-Machine Interaction Through Language research program.

My current research interest is deep learning for code, especially with large language models and integrating symbolic reasoning. I am co-organizing the [Deep Learning for Code](https://dl4c.github.io) workshop at ICLR 2022. I have previously been more focused on semantic parsing. I have published several papers on translating natural language questions into SQL queries. To date, my most successful work on this topic is the [PICARD](/publications/picard) project, which is a state-of-the-art text-to-SQL parser. All my publications can be found [here](/publications).

I am a main contributor to [Hasktorch](http://hasktorch.org), a port of PyTorch to the Haskell programming language. I mentored students in Google Summer of Code in 2020 and 2021 that worked on the project. I developed an experimental gradually typed API for Hasktorch that optionally tracks the shapes of tensors and operations in the type system. I use Haskell for research, development, and recreation.

My path started in Germany, where I grew up and studied theoretical physics at the universities of Bayreuth and Freiburg. My studies concluded in the summer of 2011 [when I earned my Ph.D](https://www.quantum.uni-freiburg.de/gallery/doctoral-conferrals/torsten). I then moved to Canada to become a researcher at the University of Toronto. I eventually left academia and started as a software developer and data scientist at a local startup. In 2017, I moved to Montreal and joined [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com), where I developed machine learning models and solutions for businesses. Element AI was acquired in 2021, and I am now a full-time employee at ServiceNow. My resume is available [here](/resume).
