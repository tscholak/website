## Hi!

Welcome, my name is Torsten Scholak. I work at [ServiceNow Research](https://servicenow.com/), where I am a senior researcher and project leader in the Human-Machine Interaction Through Language research program.

My current research interest is deep learning for code, especially with large language models and integrating symbolic reasoning. This year, I am co-organizing the [Deep Learning for Code](https://dl4c.github.io) workshop at [ICLR](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2022). Previously, I have been more focused on semantic parsing. I have published several papers on translating natural language questions into SQL queries. To date, my most successful work on this topic is the [PICARD](/publications/picard) project, which is a state-of-the-art text-to-SQL parser. All my publications can be found [here](/publications).

I am a main contributor to [Hasktorch](http://hasktorch.org), a port of PyTorch to the [Haskell programming language](https://www.haskell.org/). I mentored two students in the Google Summers of Code of 2020 and 2021 who worked on the project. I developed an experimental gradually typed API for Hasktorch that optionally tracks the shapes of tensors and operations in the type system. I use Haskell for research, development, and recreation. This website [is](https://github.com/tscholak/website/blob/main/flake.nix) [built](https://github.com/tscholak/website/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yaml) with Haskell, [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix/), and GitHub Actions.

My path started in Germany, where I grew up and studied theoretical physics at the universities of [Bayreuth](https://www.physik.uni-bayreuth.de/de/index.php) and [Freiburg](https://www.quantum.uni-freiburg.de/home). My studies concluded in the summer of 2011 [when I earned my Ph.D](https://www.quantum.uni-freiburg.de/gallery/doctoral-conferrals/torsten). I then moved to Canada to become a researcher at the [University of Toronto](https://sites.chem.utoronto.ca/cptg/). I eventually left academia and started as a software developer and data scientist at [a local startup](https://unata.com). In 2017, I moved to Montreal and joined [Element AI](https://www.elementai.com), where I developed machine learning models and solutions for businesses. Element AI was acquired in 2021, and I am now a full-time employee at ServiceNow. My resume is available [here](/resume).
